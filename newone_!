\begin{abstract}
Fruit ripeness detection is crucial in the agriculture field to determine the time of harvest and fruit quality. Substantial crop loss might result from timing slips or delays, consequently affecting income rates. Manual detection of ripeness in fruits can be inefficient for large scale implementation and pose issues such as requiring lots of time and intensive labor. Hence, in this project, fruit ripeness is detected utilizing computer vision and machine learning technologies. The method being used will recognize the fruits and categorize their ripeness using the CNN algorithm, on the basis of the dataset it is trained on. Our system will detect ripeness of 6 different types of fruits. The convolutional layers applied different filters as feature detectors to create a feature map representing the detected input features. Then the features were shaped into one-dimensional features and sent to an Neural Network  for the ripeness classification. Data augmentation techniques are used to expand the dataset's size prior to building a trained model. This technology can be integrated with robotics to implement smart agriculture and help farmers view their crops in real time, know the number of mature fruits, plan harvesting and assist in fruit picking and sorting.

\section{Introduction}
In today’s agricultural landscape, accurately the ripeness is essential for optimizing harvest schedules, ensuring high-quality productions, and reducing waste. Traditional methods, such as visual checks and manual testing, tend to be subjective and time-consuming. The rise of precision agriculture underscores the need for sophisticated, automated methods that can reliably and consistently evaluate fruit ripeness in diverse farming environments. Hyper spectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a powerful tool in agricultural research and practice. Unlike conventional imaging, HSI captures a wide spectrum of light across numerous bands, enabling the detection of subtle differences in the biochemical composition and physical properties of crops. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, including Hyderabad, India image classification, object detection, and segmentation. By leveraging the hierarchical feature learning capability of CNNs, it is possible to extract and analyse complex patterns from hyper-spectral images. Ensemble learning, which combines the predictions of multiple models, can further enhance the robustness and accuracy of ripeness assessment by mitigating the biases and errors of individual models. When immature fruits are harvested, they are of poor quality and are often incapable of ripening; immature fruits are eventually susceptible to internal deterioration and decay. Conversely, delayed harvesting of fruits and vegetables can markedly increase chances of fruit damage, resulting in drastic postharvest loss. To control the quantitative or qualitative losses of preharvest and postharvest vegetables, it is therefore crucial to understand the delicateness of vegetables, physiological maturity conditions, and methods of timely harvesting, as well as other factors.  This project aims to integrate hyper-spectral imaging with CNN ensemble learning to develop a sophisticated system for assessing fruit ripeness in variable farm conditions. By employing this approach, we seek to achieve high precision in ripeness classification, accommodating the natural variability in fruit appearance due to differences in growing conditions, varieties, and environmental factors. Convolutional neural networks and hyperspectral imaging open new avenues to detect fruit ripeness beyond the visible spectrum. An ensemble of neural networks offers accurate ripeness assessment, ensuring fruits are picked at their peak for optimal flavour and market value. Machine learning models are transforming the way farmers assess ripeness in real-time, providing a blend of technology and traditional farming. Hyperspectral imaging reveals ripeness cues not visible to the naked eye, allowing for non-destructive analysis in farm environments. These sophisticated algorithms enable reliable and consistent ripeness detection, contributing to reduced waste and better resource management sustainable farming by minimizing unnecessary harvesting and promoting efficient resource utilization.


\section{ MATERIALS AND METHODS}

\subsection{ Data Collection}

\subsubsection{Hyper-spectral Imaging:} The process of data collection
involves taking a hyper-spectral camera to get detailed pictures
of the tomatoes at all different stages of ripeness. As part
of the approach for appraisal of the real-world applicability
of the system, images are taken under diverse environmental
conditions such as lighting and temperature \cite{b2}. This allows for
the development of a robust dataset that can give an account
of wide-ranging variations in types and stages of ripeness.
Training the model to generalize very well across different
scenarios would basically require gathering a wide variety of
images.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
\subsubsection{ Data Cleaning:} 
Data cleaning has to be performed to
make sure the quality of images before any kind of analysis
is satisfactory. This step includes noise removal from the
images intended to provide a clearer and more accurate picture.
Normalization is done on images to adjust them and maintain
uniformity in the comparison throughout the dataset \cite{b1}. Proper
preprocessing guarantees data integrity and further analysis
performance.

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction and Band Selection:}  Feature extraction and band selection are required for the high-dimensional
data coming out from the hyper-spectral imaging technique.
Here, some dimensionality reduction techniques have been
applied to reduce the complexity of the data by considering
the most relevant or significant features. The most informative
parts of the image data that play an important role in deciding
the ripeness of tomatoes were selected through the band
selection approach, which reduces the computational load and
increases the efficiency of the model \cite{b3}.

\subsection{CNN Model Development}
\subsubsection{ Single CNN Model:}
Development of a CNN model
begins with the choosing of suitable architecture that can
handle hyper-spectral data. Models like ResNet are opted
because they prove to be robust in feature extraction and
in classification tasks \cite{b5}. The training process involves usage
of labeled images so that a model can learn to distinguish
between different stages of ripeness. Evaluation metrics, such
as accuracy, are used in checking the performance of the model
in order to establish the effectiveness of the model.

\subsubsection{Transfer Learning:} Transfer learning is used to improve
the CNN model. This approach uses a pre-trained model that
is trained on an extensive large-scale database and fine-tunes
it for the given task, namely tomato ripeness detection. Fine
tuning adjusts the parameters of the model with respect to the
new task, and it utilizes the knowledge that has been learnt
from past training in improving the performance of the model
on the ripeness classification task \cite{b4}.

\subsection{Ensemble Learning}
\subsubsection{ Model Averaging:}
Actually, ensemble learning utilizes
prediction for enhancing the accuracy of classification by the
help of multiple CNN models \cite{b2}. It applies different architectures
of CNN and trains them independently; then the aggregation
of their predictions is used to produce the final output. That
may reduce the variance of the model and thus improve the
overall performance of the ripeness detection system. Hybrid
approaches combine with the hyper-spectral data other data
coming from other sensors: ordinary cameras, etc. These allow
a more integral and valuable evaluation of ripeness and are
fused to provide the data, making the system more accurate
and robust in their detection.

\subsection{Hybrid Approaches:}
\subsubsection{Data Fusion:} Hybrid approaches involve data collection
from auxiliary sensors, which include cameras and hyper
spectral sensors. Combination techniques are used by combining
the various types of data. This gives a more comprehensive
assessment of tomato ripeness, and the approach becomes
multi-sensor better than unidimensional methods to ensure
more accurate and robust ripeness detection systems \cite{b5}.

\subsubsection{CNN with Traditional Image Processing:} Besides the
use of CNNs, traditional image processing methods perform
improved feature extraction. Features extraction outputs from
these methods and also outcomes of the CNNs are fused
together to provide an enriched data set for the classification
process \cite{b5}. This hybrid approach ensures that performance benefits accruable both to the old and new techniques under this model.

\section{Experimental Settings}

This section details the experimental procedures followed in developing the fruit ripeness detection model. The experiment was conducted by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a labeled dataset of real-time fruit images, with additional support from a Random Forest algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the detection \cite{IEEE_detection_model}.

\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset utilized for this study consists of over 700 real-time images of various fruits, labeled as either ripe or unripe. These images were captured under standardized lighting conditions and at various angles to ensure diversity in the training set. Key features such as texture, color, and size were carefully extracted from each image to build a robust model \cite{IEEE_feature_extraction}. The dataset was stored in the HDF5 format (\texttt{.h5}), ensuring efficient loading and training across different platforms \cite{IEEE_dataset_handling}.

Each image in the dataset was preprocessed to ensure consistency in input to the CNN model. Preprocessing steps included resizing the images to a fixed dimension of 224x224 pixels, normalization to scale pixel values between 0 and 1, and data augmentation to artificially expand the dataset. Augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, random rotations, and brightness adjustments were employed to make the model more robust against variations in real-world scenarios \cite{IEEE_data_augmentation}.

\subsection{Classifier Evaluation and Optimization}
The core classifier for fruit ripeness detection was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was trained to detect whether a fruit is ripe or unripe based on visual cues such as color, texture, and size. The CNN model was fine-tuned by applying various hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search and random search \cite{IEEE_hyperparameter_optimization}. These techniques helped identify the optimal settings for learning rate, batch size, and the number of convolutional layers in the network.

In addition to the CNN, a Random Forest algorithm was employed to improve detection accuracy, especially for cases where the texture and size features played a more significant role than color in determining ripeness. Random Forests are known for their robustness and ability to handle noisy data, making them an ideal choice for enhancing the performance of the CNN model \cite{IEEE_random_forest_cnn}. The final system leverages both classifiers in a hybrid model, where the CNN focuses on color detection, and the Random Forest classifier evaluates texture and size for a more comprehensive detection \cite{IEEE_random_forest_hybrid}.

\subsection{Model Training and Optimization}
The CNN model was trained using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 0.001. The training process involved minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss function, commonly used in multi-class classification problems \cite{IEEE_loss_function}. Early stopping was implemented to halt training once the model's performance on the validation set began to degrade, thereby preventing overfitting.

Training was performed over 50 epochs, and a batch size of 32 was selected after extensive tuning. To ensure the model's generalization ability, 90\% of the dataset was allocated to training, while the remaining 10\% was reserved for testing. The model's performance was evaluated based on several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score \cite{IEEE_cnn_model_performance}.

The Random Forest classifier was trained in parallel using texture and size features extracted from the images. This classifier was particularly useful in cases where the CNN's color-based predictions were insufficient, especially for fruits that undergo subtle texture changes as they ripen. The combination of both classifiers significantly boosted the overall detection accuracy \cite{IEEE_random_forest_accuracy}.
\subsection{Model Evaluation Metrics}

The performance of the CNN and Random Forest hybrid model for fruit ripeness detection was evaluated using commonly used classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

\paragraph{Precision:} Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. It is defined as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP):

\begin{equation}
    \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Recall:} Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all positive instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN):

\begin{equation}
    \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{F1-Score:} The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. It is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced:

\begin{equation}
    \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Accuracy:} Accuracy represents the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of predictions:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $TP$ = True Positives
    \item $TN$ = True Negatives
    \item $FP$ = False Positives
    \item $FN$ = False Negatives
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Evaluation:} The model was trained and evaluated using the above metrics, providing a comprehensive assessment of its performance in detecting ripe and unripe fruits.

\subsection{Real-time Detection System}
A real-time fruit ripeness detection system was implemented using a live camera feed, where the trained CNN model is employed to classify incoming fruit images as ripe or unripe. The system leverages a pre-trained CNN model that processes the color of the fruit, and the Random Forest algorithm, which further refines the detection by analyzing texture and size features in real time \cite{IEEE_real_time_detection}. 

The system operates by capturing fruit images from the camera feed, preprocessing the images as described earlier, and passing them through the hybrid CNN-Random Forest model. The output is displayed on the interface, indicating whether the detected fruit is ripe or unripe. This system demonstrates high accuracy and reliability in diverse lighting conditions and fruit varieties, making it suitable for real-world agricultural applications \cite{IEEE_real_world_agriculture}.

\subsection{Software and Tools Used}
The model was implemented entirely using machine learning and deep learning software libraries. Python was the primary programming language, with Keras and TensorFlow used for the CNN model implementation \cite{IEEE_deep_learning_libraries}. Scikit-learn was used for implementing the Random Forest classifier \cite{IEEE_machine_learning_tool}. All experiments were conducted on a machine equipped with an NVIDIA GPU to accelerate the training process, alongside 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7 processor \cite{IEEE_software_tools}.

The experiments were conducted on Ubuntu 20.04, and the code was developed in Jupyter Notebooks for ease of testing and iteration. The trained model was stored as an HDF5 file and later loaded for real-time detection in the fruit ripeness system.

\section{Experimental Results and Discussion}

This section presents and discusses the results obtained from various experiments conducted using different approaches to fruit ripeness detection. The approaches include using a Multi-input CNN classifier with and without optimization and ensemble learning with an optimized CNN. We also compare machine detection with human detection capabilities.

\subsection{Multi-input CNN Classifier without Optimization}

The initial experiment involved using a basic multi-input Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) without any hyperparameter optimization. The model was trained on the fruit dataset with a standard learning rate and batch size. The performance metrics for this classifier were suboptimal, as it struggled to generalize well on the test set due to the lack of fine-tuning \cite{IEEE_cnn_basics}.

The accuracy achieved was 72\%, with a relatively lower F1-score of 0.68. This result indicates that while the model could make decent predictions, the classification was not robust enough, particularly in identifying subtle changes in texture and size \cite{IEEE_performance_metrics}.

\subsection{Multi-input CNN Classifier with Optimization}

In the next experiment, the same multi-input CNN classifier was fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search \cite{IEEE_hyperparameter_search}. The learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers were adjusted to improve the model’s performance. The optimized classifier showed significant improvements in all performance metrics.

After optimization, the accuracy increased to 84\%, and the F1-score rose to 0.81. The model became better at detecting ripeness, especially when the texture and size features were critical for classification. The optimization helped reduce overfitting and improved the generalization on unseen data \cite{IEEE_optimization_improvements}.

\subsection{Performance Evaluation of Different CNN Models for Fruit Ripeness Detection}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Evaluation of different CNN models for fruit ripeness detection.}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1-Score} \\ \hline
CNN without Optimization & 72\% & 0.70 & 0.66 & 0.68 \\ \hline
Optimized CNN & 84\% & 0.83 & 0.80 & 0.81 \\ \hline
Ensemble Model (CNN + RF) & 88\% & 0.87 & 0.85 & 0.86 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\label{table:cnn_performance}
\end{table}


As shown in Table 2, the performance of the CNN model improves significantly after optimization. The ensemble learning approach further boosts the accuracy and other metrics \cite{IEEE_ensemble_learning}.

\subsection{Ensemble Learning with Optimized Multi-input CNN}

For the final approach, an ensemble learning technique was applied, where the optimized multi-input CNN was combined with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The ensemble model took advantage of the CNN’s strength in color detection and the Random Forest’s ability to handle texture and size features \cite{IEEE_rf_cnn_combination}.

This ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 88\%, with an F1-score of 0.86. This hybrid approach proved to be the most effective in detecting fruit ripeness, particularly when dealing with complex ripening stages where multiple features like texture, color, and size had to be analyzed simultaneously \cite{IEEE_hybrid_model}.

\subsection{Human Ripeness Detection vs Machine Ripeness Detection}

A comparison was made between human detection of fruit ripeness and machine-based detection. Human participants were asked to visually inspect the fruits and classify them as ripe or unripe. The accuracy of human detection was around 75\%, which is close to the performance of the non-optimized CNN model \cite{IEEE_human_vs_machine}.

In contrast, the optimized CNN and ensemble model significantly outperformed human detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in automating and improving the accuracy of ripeness detection \cite{IEEE_ml_vs_human}. 

\subsection{Discussion}

From the results, it is evident that the performance of the CNN model improves substantially with proper optimization and ensemble learning. The basic CNN model, although functional, lacked the precision and recall necessary for reliable ripeness detection \cite{IEEE_baseline_comparison}. Optimization techniques, such as grid search for hyperparameter tuning, made the model more robust, allowing it to better generalize to unseen data \cite{IEEE_hyperparameter_search}.

Furthermore, the ensemble learning approach that combined the CNN and Random Forest classifiers produced the best results, outperforming both the individual models and human detection in terms of accuracy and consistency \cite{IEEE_ensemble_hybrid_success}. This hybrid model provides a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of both deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques, making it suitable for real-time agricultural applications \cite{IEEE_real_time_agriculture}.




\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we developed a fruit ripeness detection model that effectively leverages a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random Forest algorithms \cite{IEEE_random_forest_hybrid}. The model was trained on a well-structured dataset of over 700 labeled images, capturing various fruits under controlled conditions \cite{IEEE_dataset_handling}. This dataset was pivotal in allowing the model to learn the critical visual cues indicative of ripeness, such as color, texture, and size \cite{IEEE_feature_extraction}.

The rigorous preprocessing steps, including image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, enhanced the model's robustness and generalization capabilities \cite{IEEE_data_augmentation}. Hyperparameter optimization techniques, particularly grid search, were applied to fine-tune the CNN's parameters, resulting in substantial improvements in performance metrics, notably achieving an F1-score of 0.86 in the hybrid model \cite{IEEE_hyperparameter_optimization}.

The real-time detection system developed within this project demonstrates practical applicability in agriculture by processing live camera feeds to classify fruits as ripe or unripe \cite{IEEE_real_time_detection}. This capability provides farmers and retailers with a reliable decision-making tool, optimizing harvest timing and enhancing operational efficiency.

Furthermore, our comparative analysis revealed that while human inspectors exhibited reasonable accuracy, the machine learning model consistently outperformed human detection \cite{IEEE_human_vs_machine}. This highlights the potential of AI to streamline agricultural processes, reduce human error, and increase overall efficiency in fruit handling.

Overall, this project underscores the transformative impact of technology in agriculture. The insights gained pave the way for future research and development, with possibilities for integrating additional features, such as environmental sensors or market data, to enhance the fruit ripeness detection system. As we move toward a more data-driven agricultural landscape, the collaboration between technology and agriculture will be essential in addressing food production and sustainability challenges \cite{IEEE_real_time_agriculture}.
